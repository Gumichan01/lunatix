    *        atomically here means
    *        "atomically with respect to access by another thread to the mutex and then the condition variable".
    *        That is, if another thread is able to acquire the mutex

    *        in that thread shall behave as if it were issued
    *        after the about-to-block thread has blocked.
    *   @note 3 - The effect os using more than one mutex for concurrent
    *        signal() or broadcat() operations on the same condition variable is undefined.
    *        Because the condition variable is bound to a unique mutex when
    *        a thread waits on this condition variable, and this binding ends
