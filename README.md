 LunatiX Engine is a SDL-based game engine. It can be used for open-source or commercial games thanks to the zlib/libpng license. 

 It contains these following libraries: 

 - LX_Graphics : a 2D library based on SDL and SDL_Image
 - LX_TrueTypeFont : a True Type Font (TTF) library based on SDL_TTF
 - LX_Mixer : a mix library using SDL_Mixer
 - LX_Physics : a physics engine 

 At the moment, the engine only works on windows. The Linux support will be done soon.

 
 You can find the library reference [here](http://gumichan01.olympe.in/reference/lunatix-engine/)

 Lunatix Engine (new version with SDL2), is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzqOweb9HuKBLTNGV0hiRmFLb0E&authuser=0)
