# LunatiX Engine - Release note #

## New features ##

  - Particles system
  - Random Number generator (RNG) using the Xorshift* and The C library
  - I/O file library
  - File buffering



## Details ##

 - The particle system handles several particles. Each particle you create may be  
used by a system. Each particle system works with a specific window. That means  
the particles handled by the system will be diplayed on the same window.  
This window is defined by the ID. The ID is just a reference to a window stored  
in the Window manager. So, to use the particle system, you need to store the  
windows you create to use a particle system on it into the window manager.  
 
 - The random number generator (RNG) is a library that provides two RNGs:
 - The Xorshift* RNG
 - The standard C RNG
 
 Be careful : do not forget to initialize the RNGs. Please take a look on the reference  

 - The Input/Output file library provides a simple tool to handle any files.  
You can do basic operation on files like read/write/seek/tell, and even  
try to retrieve a SDL_Surface from the file if the content refers to an image.  

 - The file buffering is a specific abstraction of the Input/Output file library.  
It allows you to retrieve the content of a file and store data in memory.  
The buffer you rerieved is not directly writable or readable to keep the data encapsulation.  
However, you can get a SDL\_Surface, a TTF\_Font, or a Mix\_Chunk from that buffer.  
Thanks to the file buffering, you can store an asset in memory and load it many  
times. This is more efficient because you do not need to retrieve a data directly on  
a file stored in the hard disk each time.



## [UPDATE] Changes from 0.5.1 ##

 - Fixed some memory leaks in LX_Font and LX_Particles
 - Added some getters into the particle engine.  
These functions have the following syntax: nb[Total/Empty/Real]Particles()


## Changes from version 0.4 and 0.3 ##

 - Fixed a critical bug in LX_TrueTypeFont. A inifinite recursion occured when  
you call drawShadedText.  
See Commit [b73f5ca] (https://github.com/Gumichan01/lunatix-engine/commit/b73f5cae50c4753d63d8a7a2b66abe8c6fdddd98)
 
 - LX_TrueTypeFont was improved, now it uses the file buffering to load  
the font file once and only works with the buffer. It is more efficient to display a text.  

 - The dependency graph of the engine was completely refactored to avoid  
redondant inclusions and lightly improve the time of compilation.  

 - The minimum version of SDL2 changed. Now you need SDL 2.0.3.


## Other changes ##

 - (v0.4) Some functions in LX_Font was refactored. So you will have *drawSomething()* instead of *draw_Something()*  
See Commit [a690ebe] (https://github.com/Gumichan01/lunatix-engine/commit/a690ebe2e20bb6acbb0398cda461765e6c0b0250)  

 - (v0.4) Integrated a simple error handling and system information.  

 - (v0.4) Improved the physics engine. It handles a complete collision detection  
 and movement.  
 
 - (v0.4) Added a rotation support in the renderer.  

 - (v0.3) A basic OpenGL loading support. Well, you can just load the library with the engine.  

 - (v0.3) Multiple windows support.
